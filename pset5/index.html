                    For instance, on the planet Earth, man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because
                    he had achieved so much—the wheel, New York, wars and so on—whilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about
                    in the water having a good time. But conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent
                    than man—for precisely the same reasons.
